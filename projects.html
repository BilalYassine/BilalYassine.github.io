				<p class="blockp">This is a GUI which generates a playable Sudoku board as well as being able to provide a solution to the given board. The program is written in Python and makes use of a backtracking algorithm in order to return a solution to any solvable game of Sudoku.</p>

				<p class="blockpp">While building this project, I developed skills in <strong>Python</strong>,
					<strong>GUI development through tkinter</strong>, and <strong>backtracking algorithms</strong>.

				<p class="blockp">I am currently working with colleague and friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-disalle-4427b5157/">Robert DiSalle</a> to create a 2D Action Platformer for PC built through Unity Game Engine. We are utilizing C# to script enemy AI, game events, etc. as well as Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator to design characters, maps, items, etc. The game follows a young wizard, banished from his home, who must master spells, solve puzzles, and conquer dungeons to redeem himself. We hope to finish and publish the game on Steam by the end of 2020.</p>

				<p class="blockpp">This passion project has been instrumental in developing my skills for
					<strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Unity</strong>, <strong>ROS</strong>, <strong>Photoshop</strong>, <strong>Illustrator</strong>, and <strong>Git</strong>.

				<p class="blockp">I am creating an iOS app "Pokerbot" which will, with a given Texas Hold 'Em Poker hand, return a probability of winning for Pre-Flop, Flop, Run, and River, as well as compare the strength of two hands against each other in a "Heads Up" format. It will also allow you to log a history of your hands and total net profit.</p>

				<p class="blockpp">Working on Pokerbot has helped me gain strong experience in
					<strong>Swift</strong> and <strong>iOS development</strong>.

				<p class="blockp">At the end of our third-level programming course at UW-Madison, we were assigned "teammates" and asked to create a group project which would demonstrate the programming concepts we had learned over the course of the semester. Several students and I decided to make a quiz creator. We used Java and JavaFX to display a quiz generated from inputted user data. Users could create and store questions for a quiz as well as take the quizzes themselves. We made use of a hash table back-end to store user data efficiently.</p>

				<p class="blockpp">This Quiz Creator was my first experience developing a CS project as part of a group. This project was crucial in expanding my knowledge of <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>JavaFX</strong>, <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>data structures</strong>.
